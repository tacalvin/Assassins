				 </br> Welcome to the UCR Assassin Hack Team whatever. Development of this website began at the University of California Riverside Citrus Hack on the 6th November, 2015. This was our FIRST Hackathon and boy was it 
						a blast. To make things even more interesting, we ended up using multiple languages in which we had no experience with to achieve our goals. Thank God for Google. From the development of the front end to the complications of the back end, the whole event was an adventure for
						all of us. With some determination and food, we managed to overcome the struggle and succeed in our goals. Ya ummmm I'm not a good writer. My teammates made me write this soooooo ya. Then again neither of us can 
						write so ya. We're engineers hehehe. Anyway, we hope you enjoy this website and maybe in the future we'll continue development.</div></br>
